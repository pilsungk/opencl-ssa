 * Here are some samples and test programs of TinyMT for OpenCL.
 *
 * Here are three types of tinymt files.
 * - files with '_jump' suffix are using jump function. One parameter set
 * is directly written in files and users do not need to specify parameter
 * set or parameters files.
 * - files with '_jump2' suffix are also using jump function. In these files,
 * jump function is used to generate a long sequence by parallel generation.
 * No samples, only test programs.
 * - other files do not use jump function and use many parameter sets in
 * parameter files.

 * Here are following samples.
 * - sample32.cpp and sample32.cl files are samples for basic usage of 32-bit
 * unsigned integers and single precision floating point numbers.
 * - sample64.cpp and sample64.cl files are samples for basic usage of 64-bit
 * unsigned integers and double precision floating point numbers.
 * - sample32_jump.cpp and sample32_jump.cl files are samples for easy usage
 * of 32-bit unsigned integers and single precision floating point numbers.
 * - sample64_jump.cpp and sample64_jump.cl files are samples for easy
 * usage of 64-bit unsigned integers and double precision floating point
 * numbers.
 *
 * Following files will be useful for kernel programs.
 * - tinymt32.clh 32-bit tinymt which needs many parameters.
 * - tinymt32_jump.clh 32-bit tinymt with jump.
 * - tinymt64.clh 64-bit tinymt which needs many parameters.
 * - tinymt64_jump.clh 64-bit tinymt with jump.
 * - tinymt.clh included by above files.
 * - tinymt32_jump_table.clh included by tinymt32_jump.clh.
 * - tinymt64_jump_table.clh included by tinymt64_jump.clh.
